# Woody
 The Woody website is a static website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The objective of this project is to design a professional and visually appealing website for Woody, a fictional company specializing in carpenter and craftsman services. The website will showcase the services offered, display a portfolio of previous work, provide customer testimonials, and offer an easy way for potential clients to get in touch.
